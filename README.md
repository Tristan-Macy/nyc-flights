This project will focus upon the _nycflights13_ package, which contains a variety of datasets that contain information regarding flights originating from New York City. The full dataset and its documentation can be found on https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nycflights13/versions/1.0.1. This analysis will rely heavily on the flights and airports datasets to draw meaningful conclusions regarding travel and tourism. Questions this analysis will seek to answer include:

* How do departure delays (median and average) compare across the flight dataset?
* What destinations are the most popular among each origin airport?
* From which airport do the most cancellations originate from?
* Does the data include any unique travel destinations for summer months?
* Is there a relationship between departure delays and variables such as wind speed and time of day.
